# ObjectRetracter

ObjectRetracter is a script for Object/Weapon colission detection currently using a 3d mesh made up of 6 adjacent cubes that represent areas of colission, depending on which areas are triggered/active the object/weapon will move/lerp to a non active area.

## Why use this?

this is mainly an attempt to create a somewhat realistic feature for my game but it might help others with this problem, i find this approach to be far more convenient than using 2 cameras or high intensive CPU usage physics in order to prevent a weapon/object from clipping through walls or other obstacles.
